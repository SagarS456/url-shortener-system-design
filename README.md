# URL Shortener – System Design Learning Project

## Purpose
This repository is a hands-on system design learning project.
The goal is to build a URL shortener **step by step**, starting from a naive Level-0 implementation and evolving it based on real design pain points.

This approach intentionally avoids premature optimization and architecture.

---

## Learning Philosophy
- Start with the simplest possible working system
- Make trade-offs explicit
- Let problems appear naturally
- Introduce design concepts only when they solve real problems

---

## Levels
- **Level-0**: Naive, correct, minimal implementation
- Future levels will evolve the system based on observed limitations

---

## Tech Stack (Initial)
- HTTP-based backend
- File-based persistence
- Monolithic execution

(Details will evolve per level.)
